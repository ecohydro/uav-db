### Let's put our image and flight data into a database.

## Setup
You will need mongodb running on your local machine (for now).
[Get it here (MacOS)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/).

Once it is installed you can start mongodb using:

`> brew services start mongodb-community@5.0`

and you can stop it by:

`> brew services stop mongodb-community@5.0`
